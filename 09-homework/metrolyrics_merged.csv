0,0,1. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,http://www.metrolyrics.com/1-lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-lyrics-beatles.html,2015,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."

4,7,A Day In The Life,http://www.metrolyrics.com/a-day-in-the-life-lyrics-beatles.html,1996,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on"
5,6,A Hard Day's Night,http://www.metrolyrics.com/a-hard-days-night-lyrics-beatles.html,1973,"It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright owww!
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log

What is it?
It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead.
Oh!
It says, ""
Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all.
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice.

And your feet start a-movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of it
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you
And the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues

9,7,Abbey Road Medley,http://www.metrolyrics.com/abbey-road-medley-lyrics-beatles.html,2010,"You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Yes it did (na, na)

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a dirty old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
She doesn't stop; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh, look out!
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though I thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
Although she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh, yeah
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep. pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
I never give you my pillow
I only give you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
Boy, you're gonna Darry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Oh yeah!
All right!
Are you going to be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
And, in The End
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I got to get a bellyful of wine
Her majesty's a real nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm going to make her mine"
10,7,Across The Universe,http://www.metrolyrics.com/across-the-universe-lyrics-beatles.html,1988,"Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth
Are ringing through my open views
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this gray.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
Sunset doesn't last all evening.
A mind can blow those clouds away.
After all this
My love is up and must be leaving.
It's not always been this gray.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
All things must pass.
None of life's dreams can last.
So, I must be on my way
To face another day
Now darkness only stays the nighttime.
In the morning it will fade away.
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time.
It's not always gonna be this gray.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away."

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago
I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
""All you need is love""
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago.
(All those years ago)
(All those years ago)
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago.
All those years ago ...
All those years ago ...
All those years ago ..."

He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers' chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, your mama's head has got to stop

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years"

The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
that seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so...

And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be so"", oh, oh, oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
P.C. 31
Said ""We've caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie
Screaming from the gallery
Say ""He must go free"" (""Maxwell must go free"")
The judge does not agree
And he tells them so, oh, oh, oh

Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man

To watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why,
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.

No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry,
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die.
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see.
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me.

To come and see
An octopus' garden

In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would be warm
Below the storm
In our little hideaway
Beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the seabed
In an octopus' garden
Near a cave
We would sing
And dance around
Because we know
We can't be found
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would shout
And swim about
The coral that lies
Beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy
For every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy
And they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy
You and me
No one there to tell us
What to do
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden

What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear

Is a little off and out of key

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Here beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
For a fish and finger pie
In summer meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane"

John: Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
Brian: Now, what do you, uh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
John: No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
Brian: Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, uh--
Paul: Like riding on a bus?
Brian: Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
Paul: Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
John: We go to certain ones.
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.

As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She,... (we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrified most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years
Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Greeting a man from the Motortrade
She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside, that was always denied,
for so many years,.
She's leaving home"

I think I know I mean a 'Yes' but it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.

Could be the same
As sweet georgia brown.
Crazy feet that dance so neat
Has sweet georgia brown.
Fella's sigh, and even cry
For sweet georgia brown.
I tell you just why
You know I don't lie.
It's been said
She knocks them dead
In any old town.
Since she came right
It's a shame
How she brings them down.
In Liverpool she even dared
To critize the Beatles' hair.
With their whole fan club
Standing there
I mean sweet georgia brown.
I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you
Think so. not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music
Sweet georgia is known to mind,
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows
But she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry,
They want to die
When georgie does the twist
I never would try
To tell you just why.
Use your imagination
Theres a dj crazy for her
Living in out home town
Since she came it's a shame
She turns him down
Records that she can get
Are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have dina,
But that don't have georgia brown.
Oh that sweet georgia,
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh.
Sweet georgia brown."

Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
""You've got to go back""
You know, they didn't even give us a chance
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
So from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said
""Say, what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul
Think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
Newspapers said
""She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said, ""We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me

See the world spinning round

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine

Some are dead and some are living

And with all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl

Love me all the time, girl

You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think For Yourself

Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good

Spending someone's hard-earned pay

Not arriving

Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home

Standing solo in the sun

Will you still feed me

And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy
Mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden
Digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer
Fill in a form
Mine for evermore

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

And the people who gain the world and lose their soul

You only give me your funny paper,
And in the middle of negotiations, you break down.
I never give you my number,
I only give you my situation,
And in the middle of investigation, I break down.
Out of college, money spent,
See no future, pay no rent,
All the money's gone, nowhere to go.
Any jobber got the sack,
Monday morning turning back,
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go.
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go!
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go!
Ah Ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine.
Soon we'll be away from here,
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away.
One sweet dream came true today,
Came true today, came true today.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
All good children go to heaven..."
